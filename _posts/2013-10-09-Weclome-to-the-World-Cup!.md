Welcome to the World Cup!
Andrés Silva

12 of June 2014 is the date in the back of every football fan’s head. The most anticipated sporting event in the world approaches, and every day the hype for it increases monumentally. However, there is still some time before the big kick-off, and there are a number of countries still fighting for a place in the most prestigious competition in football. Teams that are expected to challenge for the trophy by tradition, underdogs from the group stages and some of the familiar faces for the last chance match will meet on November 13 and 15 for some of the toughest matches of the year.

UEFA Qualification Play-Off     (November 15)
Greece     vs.    Romania
Iceland     vs.    Croatia
Ukraine     vs.    France
Portugal    vs.    Sweden
Inter-confederation Qualification Play-Off     (November 13)
Jordan    vs.    Uruguay
Mexico    vs.    New Zealand

Portugal will play Sweden on November 15, a match seen by many as Cristiano Ronaldo vs. Zlatan Ibrahimovic; two of the very best footballers in the world fighting for a spot in the World Cup. Whoever loses this match will be undoubtedly missed in the World Cup, but the promise of such an intense contest may help relieve the pain of having players of such caliber absent from the big event.
Iceland will play Croatia on the same day: the underdogs vs. the overachievers. Iceland gave a big surprise when they finished second in their group and showed that they were no longer a team to take lightly, but Croatia played some of the best football they have ever played in the past few years, and they now find themselves 18th in the FIFA ranking for national teams.
Ukraine is not seen as an equal team to France, but “Les Bleus” will have to play well to win this match. France lifted their form immensely over the last couple of months, but according to FIFA, it was not enough to top the world’s number one: Spain.
Uruguay and Mexico are expected to easily deal with Jordan and New Zealand, respectively, but it is often said that anything can happen in football.
All of the footballing fans will want to know the results of these matches, but for now, all there is left to do is to wait for mid-November. Anything may happen and nothing is certain, but struggle, tears, quality football, and goals will come when the last push arrives.
