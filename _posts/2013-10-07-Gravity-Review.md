Consensus: A great story, with a masterful presentation. 

Luis Arreaga

It is important to go into this film with minimal expectations, despite the high praise that you have no doubt been seeing. This film doesn’t offer some kind of thought provoking message, nor does it break any sort of ground in storytelling. That’s not to say the story is weak, because it’s far from that. But there is a whole other reason why this film has been receiving such unanimous praise. The film’s biggest strength is in its presentation. Given the setting, it’s curious to see how this would be handled. As it turns out, this film has a remarkable presentation. The cinematography, the sound, the overall atmosphere; Alfonso Cuarón (Prisoner of Azkaban, Children of Men) does a superb job at immersing viewers into the spatial eeriness of ‘Gravity.’

The film uses a very minimal cast. In fact, the whole film technically has only two characters, played by George Clooney and Sandra Bullock. There’s a nice contrast between the experienced, calm optimist, and the frightened, but persistent lead character. Given the small amount of characters, it gives them time to breathe and reflect on the dire nature of their situation, as opposed to the narrative being overwhelmed by an abundance of extraneous characters. In many other films characterized by looming danger, a viewer like myself just waits for the next character to be killed off, because that person is clearly there as filler, and little more. This is why the narrative in Gravity succeeds, because fewer characters mean more development. If you can make it through Sandra Bullock’s constant breathing, you will find yourself wanting her character to survive.

The screenplay is adequate, with perfectly set-up scenarios (despite some questionably convenient plot devices). The eventful scenarios are actually scarce, but when they occur, they are really riveting. Again, as with the characters, the less there is, the more it hits. Another part of the film consists of the problem-solving scenarios. Sometimes, something convenient emerges when things look dire, and while it does elicit a strong feeling of momentary relief, you can’t help but be reminded that you’re watching a Hollywood film. This aspect isn’t too bothersome, but you may feel a little letdown by all the praise that film has been given. Some of the physics also act very unrealistically, such as fire. Still, the tension is quite high when Sandra Bullock slips or stumbles whenever she is trying to grab something, knowing that if she misses, she’ll be forever lost in space.

As said before, the best part of the film is the way it’s presented. Right off the bat, the camera work is perfect. There’s no better way to compliment the spatial setting than to replicate its floating feeling. In scenes where a character spins around, the camera spins too. When everything is relaxed, the camera simply floats, not to mention the absolutely gorgeous view of Earth continually in the background. The attention to detail is astonishing too. There is one scene where a Marvin the Martian figure is just floating around; there is not much to it, but it shows the appreciation that went into the setting. When the more explosive situations occur, the effects are brilliant. The big budget is used on every intricate detail of debris, and the gravitational pull also looks fantastic. The sound is no doubt the best part of the film. The sound that is heard does not come from space itself, but what the characters hear. They can still hear themselves speak, and when they are tugged or shoved around into something, the thud is heard too. But, everything else is silent. Merely describing it does not do it justice; it simply needs to be experienced on the big screen.

Gravity is a solidly told story, but truly shines as a technical marvel. For this reason, Gravity is best experienced on the big screen. This will compliment the large scale of space, and thus contribute to the setting. 3D is not required, but it has a surprisingly good effect on the film. Once again, this will film will be not be remembered for having an innovative narrative or heart wrenching drama, but for its masterful presentation that sucks the viewer into the beautiful and dangerous, dark void of Gravity.
