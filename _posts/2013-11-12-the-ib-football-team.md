As an idea for a CAS Project, a couple of friends from IB decided to form, manage, coach, and play on a football team. They named it Cheese-Pizza Football Team, sometimes referred simply as C.P.F.C, and it was officially founded September 10th, 2013. Their first practice took place only four days after, on the following Saturday. The team quickly recruited players from different nationalities, and in the short time from the club’s birth to its first practice, the club already had 15 players attend the first practice. As weeks have gone by , the team has kept growing, both in members and in skill level. Being an IB-originated club, English being the spoken language amongst the members of the team was to be expected. But with the diverse nationalities of the team, Spanish is quite prevalent as well. The team has one practice per week in which every member has the chance to meet new people, gain some fitness, and enjoy a good football match. Anybody that plays football or wishes to learn how to play is invited to take part in practice.
