Elitism in Nerd Culture

Rebekka Mitra

    Us nerds have come a long way since the days of hiding in our parents’ basements, reassembling Xerox Altoa and IBM 5100 and finding solace in the worlds of J.R.R. Tolkien and Orson Scott Card between stinky bathroom stalls. Social misfits in the mundane and confining lives of our high school contemporaries, we passionately chose to escape to worlds where anything was possible and live adventures we knew suburbia could never offer us. Rejected by the jocks and cheerleaders seeking an easy target, we eventually found each other and moved from bathroom stalls to rallying at our own table in lunchrooms of testosterone and pretend. Eventually, things got better – we increased in numbers, the quarterback who used to bully us for our lunch money, now the cashier at the local tank station, looks at us with a pitiful mixture shame and spiteful jealousy and we feel all of the vengeful pride in being undeniably superiour to him. Eternal geek Bill Gates became one of the richest and idolized men in the world, superhero movies made record sales in the box office, the computers we used to be the only ones invested in were safely planted into all homes in the western world and suddenly we found ourselves in a world of “I heart nerds”, square rimmed glasses, proclamations of “intelligence is sexy” and “geek is the new black.” Discussions of the inner workings of Skyrim in the lunch room were now inexplicably commonplace, and to us, haven gotten used to being the alien in the planet of society, this change did nothing but perturb us. We, the suffering of that time clouded by bitter nostalgia, longingly looked back to the time of bathroom stalls and dusty basements. And in this midst of our feelings of saudade we came to resent anyone a part of the “them” claiming to be a part of the “us.”
    It is this phenomenon that the theories of self-categorisation and social identity seek to explain, both bringing the basic truth to the table: We care a lot about belonging to a predetermined social group or identity. So much in fact that we actively and passively work to construct our existence to conform to the norms and values of the group, our so-called “in-group”, and repudiate those who belong to supposedly conflicting groups, the “out-groups”. This problem exacerbates as a result of the power of accentuation, which exaggerates the differences between your in-group and out-group; the uniformity of the members in the groups, and finally, by the power of positive distinctiveness: the will to think of your group as better than the other groups. What can we conclude from this? Being a nerd is important to nerds and equally that others are non-nerds. If one would make the claim that being the special one – the outcast – was instrumental to the identity of a nerd, then the elimination of this element, and according to the more paranoid nerds, brought upon by “them,” would surely make them anxious about the future of the group, and thereby their own.
    For it is in this all-encompassing adaptation of our group’s characteristics to our own being that we lose ourselves and become the vehement knight guards of the port of entry into our “–dom” or “-ism.” We create ourselves, and in this process, nerds have come to meticulously imitate what we think a nerd is obligated to be in a copy-paste motion that is nothing but treacherous to ourselves. Social psychologist J.C. Turner (1985) explains: “[p]eople tend to see themselves more as the interchangeable exemplars of a social category than as unique personalities defined by their differences from others…”. Add a heightened sense of pride to this, and you will see an example of a “collective narcissist,” an individual with inflated self-love toward his or her in-group. According to social psychologists, this element is especially strong in individuals with low or damaged egos, who will seek solace in belonging to the group and see it as a defining extension of themselves, committing themselves to defend it staunchly. Furthermore, when these devout members of the group experience a difference between themselves and a fellow in-group member, they will, according to social psychology, recategorize that person to reflect these differences, which is perilous to the growth of these people, as one can predict an unhealthy urge not to want to be subject to recategorization.
    This, mixed with the paranoia of thinking that the nerd community is being infiltrated by pretenders seeking attention, transforms a previously positive and accepting community into an unwelcoming one where one must constantly prove one’s “geek cred” in order to deserve the title. Newcomers have it especially bad: In between perpetually subjugating them to trial by fire to substantiate their authenticity and never saving a breath before rubbing their lesser trivia knowledge in their innocent faces, we have forgotten that we, too, weren’t born with George Lucas’ biography installed into our brains. Shouting “noob” at anyone trifling enough not to be as up-to-date with our favourite games and shows, we have become what we despised, the snobby jocks bumping chests to affirm who’s the boss.
    Online you hear cries of blasphemy at these “cool kids” pretending to know what’s up—the pretty boys and girls who only hopped on the bandwagon because they were attracted to Sheldon Cooper’s quirkiness—the falsely constructed concept of the “Fake Geek Girl”. This meme assumes that these shallow girls are lying to everyone to attract male attention. Examples include “OMG STAR TREK IS SOO COOL – I LOVE LUKE SKYWALKER”, a picture of an unruly tomboy with the inscription “Real Nerd” and one of a princess, the “Not Real Nerd.” It seems that the thought that women will present themselves in certain ways is always for no other purpose but to please the dudes can be found anywhere. In the rejection of the conventionally attractive female nerd, nerds have immortalized the negative stereotypes imposed upon them. Women of this sub-culture thus find themselves in a perplexing paradox where their male counterparts largely, no eyebrows raised, accept the underrepresented and overly sexualized female characters in nerd entertainment, the game industry being the worst of them all, yet decry the voluntarily sexualized actual female wanting in for dishonesty. Tony Harris, popular American comic book artist, recently posted a heated rant to his Facebook page shaming the scantily clad female cosplayers for “not knowing shit about comics”, being “more pathetic than the REAL Nerds, who [THEY] secretly think are REALLY PATHETIC” and preying on the poor inexperienced nerd boys, embarrassingly failing to understand that nothing will ever give him or any other person the authority to stamp a person, nerd or non-nerd, no matter if he owns all of the Avenger comics ever published, no matter if he himself is the creator of them.
    And so we have become the very thing we hid in the bathroom stalls from, remorselessly seeking to retain the authority we suffered under, holding everyone who dares to want to sit at our table to stupendously high and narrow standards, wallowing around in our new-found pride hiding the scared little kid that didn’t fit in, still very much alive and kicking within us. So we have made a positive community built by the ones no one else would accept into one where the constant need to prove yourself trumps what lured us in in the first place. Yet nothing is hopeless, and pronouns can be changed from “them” to “us.” So if you see a science-fiction first-timer enthusiastically raving about the most basic nerd knowledge, do not, in a knee-jerk reaction, act superiour and shoot their hopeful dreams down, but invite them a seat at your table and let them grow.
