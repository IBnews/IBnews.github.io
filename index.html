      <a href='/2013/11/12/welcome-to-the-world-cup'>Welcome To The World Cup</a>
      <p>
<p>Andrés Silva</p>

<p>12 of June 2014 is the date in the back of every football fan’s head. The most anticipated sporting event in the world approaches, and every day the hype for it increases monumentally. However, there is still some time before the big kick-off, and there are a number of countries still fighting for a place in the most prestigious competition in football. Teams that are expected to challenge for the trophy by tradition, underdogs from the group stages and some of the familiar faces for the last chance match will meet on November 13 and 15 for some of the toughest matches of the year.</p>

<p>UEFA Qualification Play-Off (November 15) Greece vs. Romania Iceland vs. Croatia Ukraine vs. France Portugal vs. Sweden Inter-confederation Qualification Play-Off (November 13) Jordan vs. Uruguay Mexico vs. New Zealand</p>

<p>Portugal will play Sweden on November 15, a match seen by many as Cristiano Ronaldo vs. Zlatan Ibrahimovic; two of the very best footballers in the world fighting for a spot in the World Cup. Whoever loses this match will be undoubtedly missed in the World Cup, but the promise of such an intense contest may help relieve the pain of having players of such caliber absent from the big event. Iceland will play Croatia on the same day: the underdogs vs. the overachievers. Iceland gave a big surprise when they finished second in their group and showed that they were no longer a team to take lightly, but Croatia played some of the best football they have ever played in the past few years, and they now find themselves 18th in the FIFA ranking for national teams. Ukraine is not seen as an equal team to France, but “Les Bleus” will have to play well to win this match. France lifted their form immensely over the last couple of months, but according to FIFA, it was not enough to top the world’s number one: Spain. Uruguay and Mexico are expected to easily deal with Jordan and New Zealand, respectively, but it is often said that anything can happen in football. All of the footballing fans will want to know the results of these matches, but for now, all there is left to do is to wait for mid-November. Anything may happen and nothing is certain, but struggle, tears, quality football, and goals will come when the last push arrives.</p>

      <p>
<p>Andrés Silva</p>

<p>As an idea for a CAS Project, a couple of friends from IB decided to form, manage, coach, and play on a football team. They named it Cheese-Pizza Football Team, sometimes referred simply as C.P.F.C, and it was officially founded September 10th, 2013. Their first practice took place only four days after, on the following Saturday. The team quickly recruited players from different nationalities, and in the short time from the club’s birth to its first practice, the club already had 15 players attend the first practice. As weeks have gone by , the team has kept growing, both in members and in skill level. Being an IB-originated club, English being the spoken language amongst the members of the team was to be expected. But with the diverse nationalities of the team, Spanish is quite prevalent as well. The team has one practice per week in which every member has the chance to meet new people, gain some fitness, and enjoy a good football match. Anybody that plays football or wishes to learn how to play is invited to take part in practice.</p>

      <a href='/2013/11/12/the-government-shutdown'>The Government Shutdown</a>
      <p>
<p>Björn Björnsson</p>

<p>By now, it should be quite clear that the majority of Republicans strongly oppose the Affordable Care Act (popularly known as “Obamacare”). Here is an explanation of how and why the government was shut down:</p>

<p>Every year, United States Congress (i.e. the House of Representatives and Senate) has to pass spending bills. The annual deadline for this is September 30th. This year, however, the spending bills did not get passed due to a disagreement between the two parties: Republicans of the House of Representatives wanted to pass spending bills that would effectively defund Obamacare. Democrats of the Senate, of course, wanted the opposite (it is important to note that Republicans have the majority vote in the House, whereas Democrats have the majority in the Senate; if one of the two parties were to rule both chambers of Congress, the shutdown would not have occurred). Harry Reid, Senate Majority Leader, said the Senate Democrats would “not go to conference with a gun to [their] head.” The lack of consensus lead to the government shutting down.</p>

<p>During the shutdown, approximately 800,000 federal employees were furloughed and did not receive pay. National parks and monuments were closed off. With money not being earned by the federal employees and no money being spent on national parks and monuments, one must wonder how the US economy was affected by the shutdown.</p>

<p>Standard &amp; Poor estimated that the shutdown cost the United States $24 billion. Despite the wide acceptance of this figure, the cost has been questioned by some. Forbes.com claims that the government shutdown will have no long-term economic impact at all; for example, the money lost from not going to tourist sites will likely have been spent somewhere else instead. Though almost all federal employees were not paid during the shutdown (with the exception of Congress, the President, and a few others), these employees will be paid for those days of work during the shutdown. Despite this evidence that the US economy may not have been affected, it is important to not that the US dollar decreased during the government shutdown and has continued to decrease. Correlation does not imply causation, but the figure of $24 billion may have made the world market uneasy; for example, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 133 points on the 14th of October.</p>

<p>The effects of the shutdown do not stop there: a recent Gallup poll revealed that the Republican Party currently has a 28% approval rating—an all-time low. This begs the question: will this mean a lot of Republicans won’t be re-elected for Congress next year? At first glance, it may seem so. That is, until one looks back at the statistics of 2008: 94% of Congress was re-elected, despite an approval rating of 19%. There are two main causes of these numbers—timing and gerrymandering. It is rather easy to conclude that Republicans would never have made this type of decision during an election year. If the past is any indication of the future, then one can assume that the general public will not remember the impact of the shutdown as clearly a year from now as they presently do. Of course, the Democratic Party is hoping to keep the events of early October fresh in our memories, already making Facebook posts that tell the voters to remember what happened. The other primary cause of these numbers is gerrymandering.</p>

<p>Gerrymandering is an interesting loophole in the American legal system. When looking at a map of voting districts, one may wonder how they all got their peculiar shapes. Essentially, gerrymandering is the altering of a voting district in favor of a political party. In other words, This allows this district’s representative (or another member of their party) to remain in office longer than they may otherwise have. This could explain the shocking differences between approval rating and re-election rates. Gerrymandering will often lead to some districts having many more voters than others (malapportionment), which will effectively give some voters more power than others (voters in districts low in people will have more of a say in the election of a representative). This will in turn be a biased representation of the public’s opinion; if everyone is not getting an equal say when voting, then the elected representation will not be accurate. Malapportionment has, however, gotten better; the 1964 US Supreme Court case of Reynolds v. Sims ruled that state legislative districts must be equal in proportion. At the time, some district population sizes varied by as much as 1,081:1. However, the main problem of gerrymandering still remains: new district lines are able to be drawn in order to favor a political party.</p>

<p>On October 16th, the debt ceiling—the limit determined by Congress on how much money the federal government can borrow—was raised. This “fix,” however, is quite temporary. The same process of passing spending bills will occur again in January. It’ll be interesting to see whether history will, once again, repeat itself.</p>

<p>Elitism in Nerd Culture</p>

<p>Rebekka Mitra</p>

<pre><code>Us nerds have come a long way since the days of hiding in our parents’ basements, reassembling Xerox Altoa and IBM 5100 and finding solace in the worlds of J.R.R. Tolkien and Orson Scott Card between stinky bathroom stalls. Social misfits in the mundane and confining lives of our high school contemporaries, we passionately chose to escape to worlds where anything was possible and live adventures we knew suburbia could never offer us. Rejected by the jocks and cheerleaders seeking an easy target, we eventually found each other and moved from bathroom stalls to rallying at our own table in lunchrooms of testosterone and pretend. Eventually, things got better – we increased in numbers, the quarterback who used to bully us for our lunch money, now the cashier at the local tank station, looks at us with a pitiful mixture shame and spiteful jealousy and we feel all of the vengeful pride in being undeniably superiour to him. Eternal geek Bill Gates became one of the richest and idolized men in the world, superhero movies made record sales in the box office, the computers we used to be the only ones invested in were safely planted into all homes in the western world and suddenly we found ourselves in a world of “I heart nerds”, square rimmed glasses, proclamations of “intelligence is sexy” and “geek is the new black.” Discussions of the inner workings of Skyrim in the lunch room were now inexplicably commonplace, and to us, haven gotten used to being the alien in the planet of society, this change did nothing but perturb us. We, the suffering of that time clouded by bitter nostalgia, longingly looked back to the time of bathroom stalls and dusty basements. And in this midst of our feelings of saudade we came to resent anyone a part of the “them” claiming to be a part of the “us.”
It is this phenomenon that the theories of self-categorisation and social identity seek to explain, both bringing the basic truth to the table: We care a lot about belonging to a predetermined social group or identity. So much in fact that we actively and passively work to construct our existence to conform to the norms and values of the group, our so-called “in-group”, and repudiate those who belong to supposedly conflicting groups, the “out-groups”. This problem exacerbates as a result of the power of accentuation, which exaggerates the differences between your in-group and out-group; the uniformity of the members in the groups, and finally, by the power of positive distinctiveness: the will to think of your group as better than the other groups. What can we conclude from this? Being a nerd is important to nerds and equally that others are non-nerds. If one would make the claim that being the special one – the outcast – was instrumental to the identity of a nerd, then the elimination of this element, and according to the more paranoid nerds, brought upon by “them,” would surely make them anxious about the future of the group, and thereby their own.
For it is in this all-encompassing adaptation of our group’s characteristics to our own being that we lose ourselves and become the vehement knight guards of the port of entry into our “–dom” or “-ism.” We create ourselves, and in this process, nerds have come to meticulously imitate what we think a nerd is obligated to be in a copy-paste motion that is nothing but treacherous to ourselves. Social psychologist J.C. Turner (1985) explains: “[p]eople tend to see themselves more as the interchangeable exemplars of a social category than as unique personalities defined by their differences from others…”. Add a heightened sense of pride to this, and you will see an example of a “collective narcissist,” an individual with inflated self-love toward his or her in-group. According to social psychologists, this element is especially strong in individuals with low or damaged egos, who will seek solace in belonging to the group and see it as a defining extension of themselves, committing themselves to defend it staunchly. Furthermore, when these devout members of the group experience a difference between themselves and a fellow in-group member, they will, according to social psychology, recategorize that person to reflect these differences, which is perilous to the growth of these people, as one can predict an unhealthy urge not to want to be subject to recategorization.
This, mixed with the paranoia of thinking that the nerd community is being infiltrated by pretenders seeking attention, transforms a previously positive and accepting community into an unwelcoming one where one must constantly prove one’s “geek cred” in order to deserve the title. Newcomers have it especially bad: In between perpetually subjugating them to trial by fire to substantiate their authenticity and never saving a breath before rubbing their lesser trivia knowledge in their innocent faces, we have forgotten that we, too, weren’t born with George Lucas’ biography installed into our brains. Shouting “noob” at anyone trifling enough not to be as up-to-date with our favourite games and shows, we have become what we despised, the snobby jocks bumping chests to affirm who’s the boss.
Online you hear cries of blasphemy at these “cool kids” pretending to know what’s up—the pretty boys and girls who only hopped on the bandwagon because they were attracted to Sheldon Cooper’s quirkiness—the falsely constructed concept of the “Fake Geek Girl”. This meme assumes that these shallow girls are lying to everyone to attract male attention. Examples include “OMG STAR TREK IS SOO COOL – I LOVE LUKE SKYWALKER”, a picture of an unruly tomboy with the inscription “Real Nerd” and one of a princess, the “Not Real Nerd.” It seems that the thought that women will present themselves in certain ways is always for no other purpose but to please the dudes can be found anywhere. In the rejection of the conventionally attractive female nerd, nerds have immortalized the negative stereotypes imposed upon them. Women of this sub-culture thus find themselves in a perplexing paradox where their male counterparts largely, no eyebrows raised, accept the underrepresented and overly sexualized female characters in nerd entertainment, the game industry being the worst of them all, yet decry the voluntarily sexualized actual female wanting in for dishonesty. Tony Harris, popular American comic book artist, recently posted a heated rant to his Facebook page shaming the scantily clad female cosplayers for “not knowing shit about comics”, being “more pathetic than the REAL Nerds, who [THEY] secretly think are REALLY PATHETIC” and preying on the poor inexperienced nerd boys, embarrassingly failing to understand that nothing will ever give him or any other person the authority to stamp a person, nerd or non-nerd, no matter if he owns all of the Avenger comics ever published, no matter if he himself is the creator of them.
And so we have become the very thing we hid in the bathroom stalls from, remorselessly seeking to retain the authority we suffered under, holding everyone who dares to want to sit at our table to stupendously high and narrow standards, wallowing around in our new-found pride hiding the scared little kid that didn’t fit in, still very much alive and kicking within us. So we have made a positive community built by the ones no one else would accept into one where the constant need to prove yourself trumps what lured us in in the first place. Yet nothing is hopeless, and pronouns can be changed from “them” to “us.” So if you see a science-fiction first-timer enthusiastically raving about the most basic nerd knowledge, do not, in a knee-jerk reaction, act superiour and shoot their hopeful dreams down, but invite them a seat at your table and let them grow.</code></pre>

      <a href='/2013/11/12/gravity-review'>Gravity Review</a>
      <p>
<p>Luis Arreaga</p>

<p>It is important to go into this film with minimal expectations, despite the high praise that you have no doubt been seeing. This film doesn’t offer some kind of thought provoking message, nor does it break any sort of ground in storytelling. That’s not to say the story is weak, because it’s far from that. But there is a whole other reason why this film has been receiving such unanimous praise. The film’s biggest strength is in its presentation. Given the setting, it’s curious to see how this would be handled. As it turns out, this film has a remarkable presentation. The cinematography, the sound, the overall atmosphere; Alfonso Cuarón (Prisoner of Azkaban, Children of Men) does a superb job at immersing viewers into the spatial eeriness of ‘Gravity.’</p>

<p>The film uses a very minimal cast. In fact, the whole film technically has only two characters, played by George Clooney and Sandra Bullock. There’s a nice contrast between the experienced, calm optimist, and the frightened, but persistent lead character. Given the small amount of characters, it gives them time to breathe and reflect on the dire nature of their situation, as opposed to the narrative being overwhelmed by an abundance of extraneous characters. In many other films characterized by looming danger, a viewer like myself just waits for the next character to be killed off, because that person is clearly there as filler, and little more. This is why the narrative in Gravity succeeds, because fewer characters mean more development. If you can make it through Sandra Bullock’s constant breathing, you will find yourself wanting her character to survive.</p>

<p>The screenplay is adequate, with perfectly set-up scenarios (despite some questionably convenient plot devices). The eventful scenarios are actually scarce, but when they occur, they are really riveting. Again, as with the characters, the less there is, the more it hits. Another part of the film consists of the problem-solving scenarios. Sometimes, something convenient emerges when things look dire, and while it does elicit a strong feeling of momentary relief, you can’t help but be reminded that you’re watching a Hollywood film. This aspect isn’t too bothersome, but you may feel a little letdown by all the praise that film has been given. Some of the physics also act very unrealistically, such as fire. Still, the tension is quite high when Sandra Bullock slips or stumbles whenever she is trying to grab something, knowing that if she misses, she’ll be forever lost in space.</p>

<p>As said before, the best part of the film is the way it’s presented. Right off the bat, the camera work is perfect. There’s no better way to compliment the spatial setting than to replicate its floating feeling. In scenes where a character spins around, the camera spins too. When everything is relaxed, the camera simply floats, not to mention the absolutely gorgeous view of Earth continually in the background. The attention to detail is astonishing too. There is one scene where a Marvin the Martian figure is just floating around; there is not much to it, but it shows the appreciation that went into the setting. When the more explosive situations occur, the effects are brilliant. The big budget is used on every intricate detail of debris, and the gravitational pull also looks fantastic. The sound is no doubt the best part of the film. The sound that is heard does not come from space itself, but what the characters hear. They can still hear themselves speak, and when they are tugged or shoved around into something, the thud is heard too. But, everything else is silent. Merely describing it does not do it justice; it simply needs to be experienced on the big screen.</p>

<p>Gravity is a solidly told story, but truly shines as a technical marvel. For this reason, Gravity is best experienced on the big screen. This will compliment the large scale of space, and thus contribute to the setting. 3D is not required, but it has a surprisingly good effect on the film. Once again, this will film will be not be remembered for having an innovative narrative or heart wrenching drama, but for its masterful presentation that sucks the viewer into the beautiful and dangerous, dark void of Gravity.</p>

      <a href='/lessons/2011/12/29/jekyll-introduction'>Jekyll Introduction</a>
      <p>
<p>This Jekyll introduction will outline specifically what Jekyll is and why you would want to use it. Directly following the intro we’ll learn exactly <em>how</em> Jekyll does what it does.</p>

<h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>

<h3 id='what_is_jekyll'>What is Jekyll?</h3>

<p>Jekyll is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to build static websites from dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. Jekyll is known as “a simple, blog aware, static site generator”.</p>

<h3 id='examples'>Examples</h3>

<p>This website is created with Jekyll. <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Sites'>Other Jekyll websites</a>.</p>

<h3 id='what_does_jekyll_do'>What does Jekyll Do?</h3>

<p>Jekyll is a ruby gem you install on your local system. Once there you can call <code>jekyll --server</code> on a directory and provided that directory is setup in a way jekyll expects, it will do magic stuff like parse markdown/textile files, compute categories, tags, permalinks, and construct your pages from layout templates and partials.</p>

<p>Once parsed, Jekyll stores the result in a self-contained static <code>_site</code> folder. The intention here is that you can serve all contents in this folder statically from a plain static web-server.</p>

<p>You can think of Jekyll as a normalish dynamic blog but rather than parsing content, templates, and tags on each request, Jekyll does this once <em>beforehand</em> and caches the <em>entire website</em> in a folder for serving statically.</p>

<h3 id='jekyll_is_not_blogging_software'>Jekyll is Not Blogging Software</h3>

<p><strong>Jekyll is a parsing engine.</strong></p>

<p>Jekyll does not come with any content nor does it have any templates or design elements. This is a common source of confusion when getting started. Jekyll does not come with anything you actually use or see on your website - you have to make it.</p>

<h3 id='why_should_i_care'>Why Should I Care?</h3>

<p>Jekyll is very minimalistic and very efficient. The most important thing to realize about Jekyll is that it creates a static representation of your website requiring only a static web-server. Traditional dynamic blogs like Wordpress require a database and server-side code. Heavily trafficked dynamic blogs must employ a caching layer that ultimately performs the same job Jekyll sets out to do; serve static content.</p>

<p>Therefore if you like to keep things simple and you prefer the command-line over an admin panel UI then give Jekyll a try.</p>

<p><strong>Developers like Jekyll because we can write content like we write code:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ability to write content in markdown or textile in your favorite text-editor.</li>

<li>Ability to write and preview your content via localhost.</li>

<li>No internet connection required.</li>

<li>Ability to publish via git.</li>

<li>Ability to host your blog on a static web-server.</li>

<li>Ability to host freely on GitHub Pages.</li>

<li>No database required.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id='how_jekyll_works'>How Jekyll Works</h1>

<p>The following is a complete but concise outline of exactly how Jekyll works.</p>

<p>Be aware that core concepts are introduced in rapid succession without code examples. This information is not intended to specifically teach you how to do anything, rather it is intended to give you the <em>full picture</em> relative to what is going on in Jekyll-world.</p>

<p>Learning these core concepts should help you avoid common frustrations and ultimately help you better understand the code examples contained throughout Jekyll-Bootstrap.</p>

<h2 id='initial_setup'>Initial Setup</h2>

<p>After <a href='/index.html#start-now'>installing jekyll</a> you’ll need to format your website directory in a way jekyll expects. Jekyll-bootstrap conveniently provides the base directory format.</p>

<h3 id='the_jekyll_application_base_format'>The Jekyll Application Base Format</h3>

<p>Jekyll expects your website directory to be laid out like so:</p>

<pre><code>.
|-- _config.yml
|-- _includes
|-- _layouts
|   |-- default.html
|   |-- post.html
|-- _posts
|   |-- 2011-10-25-open-source-is-good.markdown
|   |-- 2011-04-26-hello-world.markdown
|-- _site
|-- index.html
|-- assets
    |-- css
        |-- style.css
    |-- javascripts</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>_config.yml</strong> Stores configuration data.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>_includes</strong> This folder is for partial views.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>_layouts</strong> This folder is for the main templates your content will be inserted into. You can have different layouts for different pages or page sections.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>_posts</strong> This folder contains your dynamic content/posts. the naming format is required to be <code>@YEAR-MONTH-DATE-title.MARKUP@</code>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>_site</strong> This is where the generated site will be placed once Jekyll is done transforming it.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>assets</strong> This folder is not part of the standard jekyll structure. The assets folder represents <em>any generic</em> folder you happen to create in your root directory. Directories and files not properly formatted for jekyll will be left untouched for you to serve normally.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='jekyll_configuration'>Jekyll Configuration</h3>

<p>Jekyll supports various configuration options that are fully outlined here: (<a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Configuration'>https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Configuration</a>)</p>

<h2 id='content_in_jekyll'>Content in Jekyll</h2>

<p>Content in Jekyll is either a post or a page. These content “objects” get inserted into one or more templates to build the final output for its respective static-page.</p>

<h3 id='posts_and_pages'>Posts and Pages</h3>

<p>Both posts and pages should be written in markdown, textile, or HTML and may also contain Liquid templating syntax. Both posts and pages can have meta-data assigned on a per-page basis such as title, url path, as well as arbitrary custom meta-data.</p>

<h3 id='working_with_posts'>Working With Posts</h3>

<p><strong>Creating a Post</strong> Posts are created by properly formatting a file and placing it the <code>_posts</code> folder.</p>

<p><strong>Formatting</strong> A post must have a valid filename in the form <code>YEAR-MONTH-DATE-title.MARKUP</code> and be placed in the <code>_posts</code> directory. If the data format is invalid Jekyll will not recognize the file as a post. The date and title are automatically parsed from the filename of the post file. Additionally, each file must have <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter'>YAML Front-Matter</a> prepended to its content. YAML Front-Matter is a valid YAML syntax specifying meta-data for the given file.</p>

<p><strong>Order</strong> Ordering is an important part of Jekyll but it is hard to specify a custom ordering strategy. Only reverse chronological and chronological ordering is supported in Jekyll.</p>

<p>Since the date is hard-coded into the filename format, to change the order, you must change the dates in the filenames.</p>

<p><strong>Tags</strong> Posts can have tags associated with them as part of their meta-data. Tags may be placed on posts by providing them in the post’s YAML front matter. You have access to the post-specific tags in the templates. These tags also get added to the sitewide collection.</p>

<p><strong>Categories</strong> Posts may be categorized by providing one or more categories in the YAML front matter. Categories offer more significance over tags in that they can be reflected in the URL path to the given post. Note categories in Jekyll work in a specific way. If you define more than one category you are defining a category hierarchy “set”. Example:</p>
<hr />
<pre><code>title :  Hello World
categories : [lessons, beginner]</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>This defines the category hierarchy “lessons/beginner”. Note this is <em>one category</em> node in Jekyll. You won’t find “lessons” and “beginner” as two separate categories unless you define them elsewhere as singular categories.</p>

<h3 id='working_with_pages'>Working With Pages</h3>

<p><strong>Creating a Page</strong> Pages are created by properly formatting a file and placing it anywhere in the root directory or subdirectories that do <em>not</em> start with an underscore.</p>

<p><strong>Formatting</strong> In order to register as a Jekyll page the file must contain <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter'>YAML Front-Matter</a>. Registering a page means 1) that Jekyll will process the page and 2) that the page object will be available in the <code>site.pages</code> array for inclusion into your templates.</p>

<p><strong>Categories and Tags</strong> Pages do not compute categories nor tags so defining them will have no effect.</p>

<p><strong>Sub-Directories</strong> If pages are defined in sub-directories, the path to the page will be reflected in the url. Example:</p>

<pre><code>.
|-- people
    |-- bob
        |-- essay.html</code></pre>

<p>This page will be available at <code>http://yourdomain.com/people/bob/essay.html</code></p>

<p><strong>Recommended Pages</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>index.html</strong> You will always want to define the root index.html page as this will display on your root URL.</li>

<li><strong>404.html</strong> Create a root 404.html page and GitHub Pages will serve it as your 404 response.</li>

<li><strong>sitemap.html</strong> Generating a sitemap is good practice for SEO.</li>

<li><strong>about.html</strong> A nice about page is easy to do and gives the human perspective to your website.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='templates_in_jekyll'>Templates in Jekyll</h2>

<p>Templates are used to contain a page’s or post’s content. All templates have access to a global site object variable: <code>site</code> as well as a page object variable: <code>page</code>. The site variable holds all accessible content and metadata relative to the site. The page variable holds accessible data for the given page or post being rendered at that point.</p>

<p><strong>Create a Template</strong> Templates are created by properly formatting a file and placing it in the <code>_layouts</code> directory.</p>

<p><strong>Formatting</strong> Templates should be coded in HTML and contain YAML Front Matter. All templates can contain Liquid code to work with your site’s data.</p>

<p><strong>Rending Page/Post Content in a Template</strong> There is a special variable in all templates named : <code>content</code>. The <code>content</code> variable holds the page/post content including any sub-template content previously defined. Render the content variable wherever you want your main content to be injected into your template:</p>
<pre><code>...
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div id="sidebar"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id="main"&gt;
    &#123;{content}&#125;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
...</code></pre>
<h3 id='subtemplates'>Sub-Templates</h3>

<p>Sub-templates are exactly templates with the only difference being they define another “root” layout/template within their YAML Front Matter. This essentially means a template will render inside of another template.</p>

<h3 id='includes'>Includes</h3>

<p>In Jekyll you can define include files by placing them in the <code>_includes</code> folder. Includes are NOT templates, rather they are just code snippets that get included into templates. In this way, you can treat the code inside includes as if it was native to the parent template.</p>

<p>Any valid template code may be used in includes.</p>

<h2 id='using_liquid_for_templating'>Using Liquid for Templating</h2>

<p>Templating is perhaps the most confusing and frustrating part of Jekyll. This is mainly due to the fact that Jekyll templates must use the Liquid Templating Language.</p>

<h3 id='what_is_liquid'>What is Liquid?</h3>

<p><a href='https://github.com/Shopify/liquid'>Liquid</a> is a secure templating language developed by <a href='http://shopify.com'>Shopify</a>. Liquid is designed for end-users to be able to execute logic within template files without imposing any security risk on the hosting server.</p>

<p>Jekyll uses Liquid to generate the post content within the final page layout structure and as the primary interface for working with your site and post/page data.</p>

<h3 id='why_do_we_have_to_use_liquid'>Why Do We Have to Use Liquid?</h3>

<p>GitHub uses Jekyll to power <a href='http://pages.github.com/'>GitHub Pages</a>. GitHub cannot afford to run arbitrary code on their servers so they lock developers down via Liquid.</p>

<h3 id='liquid_is_not_programmerfriendly'>Liquid is Not Programmer-Friendly.</h3>

<p>The short story is liquid is not real code and its not intended to execute real code. The point being you can’t do jackshit in liquid that hasn’t been allowed explicitly by the implementation. What’s more you can only access data-structures that have been explicitly passed to the template.</p>

<p>In Jekyll’s case it is not possible to alter what is passed to Liquid without hacking the gem or running custom plugins. Both of which cannot be supported by GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>As a programmer - this is very frustrating.</p>

<p>But rather than look a gift horse in the mouth we are going to suck it up and view it as an opportunity to work around limitations and adopt client-side solutions when possible.</p>

<p><strong>Aside</strong> My personal stance is to not invest time trying to hack liquid. It’s really unnecessary <em>from a programmer’s</em> perspective. That is to say if you have the ability to run custom plugins (i.e. run arbitrary ruby code) you are better off sticking with ruby. Toward that end I’ve built <a href='http://github.com/plusjade/mustache-with-jekyll'>Mustache-with-Jekyll</a></p>

<h2 id='static_assets'>Static Assets</h2>

<p>Static assets are any file in the root or non-underscored subfolders that are not pages. That is they have no valid YAML Front Matter and are thus not treated as Jekyll Pages.</p>

<p>Static assets should be used for images, css, and javascript files.</p>

<h2 id='how_jekyll_parses_files'>How Jekyll Parses Files</h2>

<p>Remember Jekyll is a processing engine. There are two main types of parsing in Jekyll.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Content parsing.</strong> This is done with textile or markdown.</li>

<li><strong>Template parsing.</strong> This is done with the liquid templating language.</li>
</ul>

<p>And thus there are two main types of file formats needed for this parsing.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Post and Page files.</strong> All content in Jekyll is either a post or a page so valid posts and pages are parsed with markdown or textile.</li>

<li><strong>Template files.</strong> These files go in <code>_layouts</code> folder and contain your blogs <strong>templates</strong>. They should be made in HTML with the help of Liquid syntax. Since include files are simply injected into templates they are essentially parsed as if they were native to the template.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Arbitrary files and folders.</strong> Files that <em>are not</em> valid pages are treated as static content and pass through Jekyll untouched and reside on your blog in the exact structure and format they originally existed in.</p>

<h3 id='formatting_files_for_parsing'>Formatting Files for Parsing.</h3>

<p>We’ve outlined the need for valid formatting using <strong>YAML Front Matter</strong>. Templates, posts, and pages all need to provide valid YAML Front Matter even if the Matter is empty. This is the only way Jekyll knows you want the file processed.</p>

<p>YAML Front Matter must be prepended to the top of template/post/page files:</p>
<hr />
<pre><code>layout: post
category : pages
tags : [how-to, jekyll]</code></pre>
<hr />
<pre><code>... contents ...</code></pre>

<p>Three hyphens on a new line start the Front-Matter block and three hyphens on a new line end the block. The data inside the block must be valid YAML.</p>

<p>Configuration parameters for YAML Front-Matter is outlined here: <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter'>A comprehensive explanation of YAML Front Matter</a></p>

<h4 id='defining_layouts_for_posts_and_templates_parsing'>Defining Layouts for Posts and Templates Parsing.</h4>

<p>The <code>layout</code> parameter in the YAML Front Matter defines the template file for which the given post or template should be injected into. If a template file specifies its own layout, it is effectively being used as a <code>sub-template.</code> That is to say loading a post file into a template file that refers to another template file with work in the way you’d expect; as a nested sub-template.</p>

<h2 id='how_jekyll_generates_the_final_static_files'>How Jekyll Generates the Final Static Files.</h2>

<p>Ultimately, Jekyll’s job is to generate a static representation of your website. The following is an outline of how that’s done:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Jekyll collects data.</strong> Jekyll scans the posts directory and collects all posts files as post objects. It then scans the layout assets and collects those and finally scans other directories in search of pages.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Jekyll computes data.</strong> Jekyll takes these objects, computes metadata (permalinks, tags, categories, titles, dates) from them and constructs one big <code>site</code> object that holds all the posts, pages, layouts, and respective metadata. At this stage your site is one big computed ruby object.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Jekyll liquifies posts and templates.</strong> Next jekyll loops through each post file and converts (through markdown or textile) and <strong>liquifies</strong> the post inside of its respective layout(s). Once the post is parsed and liquified inside the the proper layout structure, the layout itself is “liquified”. <strong>Liquification</strong> is defined as follows: Jekyll initiates a Liquid template, and passes a simpler hash representation of the ruby site object as well as a simpler hash representation of the ruby post object. These simplified data structures are what you have access to in the templates.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Jekyll generates output.</strong> Finally the liquid templates are “rendered”, thereby processing any liquid syntax provided in the templates and saving the final, static representation of the file.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Notes.</strong> Because Jekyll computes the entire site in one fell swoop, each template is given access to a global <code>site</code> hash that contains useful data. It is this data that you’ll iterate through and format using the Liquid tags and filters in order to render it onto a given page.</p>

<p>Remember, in Jekyll you are an end-user. Your API has only two components:</p>

<ol>
<li>The manner in which you setup your directory.</li>

<li>The liquid syntax and variables passed into the liquid templates.</li>
</ol>

<p>All the data objects available to you in the templates via Liquid are outlined in the <strong>API Section</strong> of Jekyll-Bootstrap. You can also read the original documentation here: <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Template-Data'>https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Template-Data</a></p>

<h2 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope this paints a clearer picture of what Jekyll is doing and why it works the way it does. As noted, our main programming constraint is the fact that our API is limited to what is accessible via Liquid and Liquid only.</p>

<p>Jekyll-bootstrap is intended to provide helper methods and strategies aimed at making it more intuitive and easier to work with Jekyll =)</p>
