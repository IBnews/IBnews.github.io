<p>To the IB students of MH (and anyone else with an interest in student newspapers),</p>

<p>Thank you for reading the IB News. Due to the currently-demanding schedule for us IB 2 students, the paper’s release was slightly delayed. However, expect new articles to appear regularly from now on.
You may be wondering what this newspaper is exactly. The IB News brings its readers relevant news, activities, and opinions, all brought forth in a professional manner. In comparison to a regular newspaper, these articles attempt to cover more at once while still being accessible and informative.
If you’re an IB student and would like to write for this newspaper, please let me know. The more writers, the better the newspaper. You could either write sporadically or become a full-time writer for us—both would be appreciated.
Enjoy the paper.</p>
